        <p> ShapeShift lets you convert (or "Shift") between the all of the coins/tokens offered by Jaxx. Enter the amount you want to convert (either in fiat or the coin currently being displayed), then, using the toggle button just below the Amount field, select what coin type you would like to convert to. </p>
        <p> At the bottom of the ShapeShift display, you'll see the current conversion rate and the minimum and maximum transaction size allowed by ShapeShift. </p>
        <p> Once you've made your selection, select <span>Shift</span>. This will bring you to a confirmation screen where you can review and complete the transaction. </p>
