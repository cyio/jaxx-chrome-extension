        <p>The spendable balance is the MAX amount that you can send out of your wallet. You may notice that your spendable amount is less than your actual balance- this is because it includes the mining fee that is needed to send out this transaction. <b>The bitcoin mining fee is determined by file size, not your BTC amount </b>(you can adjust the fee amount in Settings). The number of inputs and outputs in your wallet contributes to the file size.</p>
        <p class="cssLastParagraphShapeShiftInfo"><span>Please note that the bitcoin fees are much higher than what they used to be due to the rise in popularity of bitcoin and extreme network congestion.</span> </p>
